            <h3>Part 1: Dreams from Dhorpatan
            </h3>
            <p>Deep in a peaceful and remote corner of Nepal, between jade-green hills and soft streams that sang soft
                melodies, there was a village called Dhorpatan. It was a treasure of nature—a land of rolling green
                pastures, mountain ranges clothed in mist, and a sky whose hue was reminiscent of dawn. It was remote,
                peaceful, and away from the din of the modern world.
            </p>
            <p>Among the few who lived there was a boy named Arjun. Arjun was odd from an early age. While other kids
                played games and ran in the fields, Arjun hung around, watching soldiers on television or listening to
                village elders speak of sacrifice and heroism. He did not want to be a farmer or shopkeeper like the
                majority of boys in his village. Arjun's aspiration was to do one thing only: to be a soldier—a defender
                of his nation, a uniformed warrior.
            </p>
            <p>His father, a plain man who had never traveled farther than the district, would say to him, "The world is
                too big and dangerous. Why not stay at home where you are safe?" But Arjun's eyes burned with resolve.
                "I want to serve. I want to be brave," he would reply.
            </p>
            <p>At fifteen, Arjun had already begun working towards his dream with unshakeable commitment. At sunrise,
                before morning kissed the valley, he would run barefoot on uneven roads, climb hard hills carrying a bag
                full of pebbles, and exercise. In the evening, after school hours, he would exercise again in the dying
                rays of the sun. The Dhorpatan would sit and gape at him in wonder, grumbling to one another, "This boy
                is born to accomplish something greater."
            </p>
            <p>After completing secondary school, Arjun was at a crossroads. His exams were over, and his performance
                was satisfactory. His parents, seeing his determination and perseverance, made a decision that would
                alter the course of his life. They sold a part of their land—precious and hard-earned—and brought Arjun
                to Pokhara, the city of seven lakes, the hub of activity where he could enroll in an actual army
                preparation training institute.
            </p>
            <p>The village came out as a whole the morning Arjun left Dhorpatan. His mother had pressed into his hand a
                container of homemade foods, and his father had socked his shoulder in pride and silence. Arjun looked
                over his shoulder once more at the village he would never see again—the mountains, the familiar trees,
                the small stone house in which he grew up—and hopped onto the bus, his heart full of love and his mind
                burning with ambition.
            </p>
            <p>It was another world in Pokhara. Petrol, and not pine, was in the air; racing motorbikes and people
                buzzed on the roads. Arjun was not diverted by the chaos. He joined a prestigious army training college
                and immersed himself in his routine—running, weightlifting, reading, and interviewing.
            </p>
            <p>Months passed. Then came the army selection day—a day he had imagined a thousand times. He shook in his
                own hands as he stood in line, along with hundreds of others just like him. But despite all his
                practice, fear got the better of him. He flubbed the physical tests and stuttered at the final
                interview. When the shortlist was announced, Arjun's name was not included.
            </p>
            <p>Defeated, he went back to his room and sat alone, his dreams crumbling at his feet. The village boy who
                was destined to rule the world had been beaten by his own phobias.
                He thought of quitting. But something strange happened.
            </p>
            <p>Jogging one afternoon by a lonely park by the river, Arjun noticed a girl sitting alone by herself on a
                bench looking into the hills that stretched in the distance. She was lost in the gentle stream of water
                gazing out of her eyes. It was lovely to be by her side. Her face was warm and tender, like the
                moonlight across the lake.
            </p>
            <p>He halted and approached her.
            </p>
            <p>"Hey," he puffed.
            </p>
            <p>Surprised, she turned to smile nervously. "You frightened me."</p>
            <p>"Sorry," Arjun said in a rush. "I just thought. perhaps you needed assistance."
            </p>
            <p>She nodded. "No, I'm okay. I just enjoy sitting here and looking at the hills. It's so serene."
            </p>
            <p>They spoke for a few minutes. She was Meera, a young girl who had just moved to Pokhara. They discussed
                nature, their dreams, and before they parted ways, they shared social media handles.
            </p>
            <p>Meera was a surprise ray of sunshine in Arjun's life ever after. They talked a lot. She motivated him,
                told him that failure came in the way of growth, and urged him to attempt again.
            </p>
            <p>"You have something others don't," she had once penned. "You have the willingness to attempt. That's
                rare, Arjun. Don't squander it."
            </p>
            <p>Rejuvenated and rejuvenated again, Arjun returned to his training with even better control. Months
                passed. When the next round of selection came around, he stood tall and unflappable. This time, he
                didn't let fear overwhelm him. And this time, his name was on the list.</p>
            <p>
                He had made it. Arjun was a soldier now.
            </p>

            <h3>Part 2: Love, Duty, and Sacrifice

            </h3>
            <p>After Arjun completed training in India, he was granted a short holiday. He returned to Nepal, and he was
                received with publicity. His family glowed with pride. His village celebrated him as a hero. But more
                than anything else, he wanted to see Meera—the girl who had believed in him when he could not believe in
                himself.
            </p>
            <p>Their first meeting since he had returned was subdued and tearful. They did not speak much. They spoke in
                their eyes. That was the time, on the same sky where they first met, that Arjun held Meera's hands in
                his and asked the question to her, "Will you stay with me, not now but for ever?"
            </p>
            <p>She said 'yes' through tears.
            </p>
            <p>He spoke with his parents, and they agreed with their nod, to marry him during his next leave.
            </p>
            <p>Months went by, and he returned home once again—and this time, not just as a soldier, but as a
                bridegroom. In a beautiful wedding amidst loved ones and nature, Arjun and Meera got married. Their
                hearts were brimming with hope, and for a moment, life was flawless.
            </p>
            <p>They settled in a small but cozy bungalow near Dhorpatan. Arjun returned to work in India, while Meera
                waited patiently. Post and video calls and the occasional trips were their survival sustenance. A year
                passed and their love had yielded fruit—a baby boy whom they named Ayush.
            </p>
            <p>Arjun would come back home during holidays, hold his son in his arms, kiss Meera's forehead, and sit
                among the stars and his family. They were short days, golden ones.
            </p>
            <p>But peace, a dream, can be elusive.
            </p>
            <p>One evening, while Arjun was home on vacation, a phone call shattered their quiet joy. Tensions had
                flared between India and Pakistan, and a conflict had broken out in Jammu and Kashmir. Arjun’s unit had
                been called in immediately.
            </p>
            <p>His leave was canceled.
            </p>
            <p>Without hesitation, Arjun packed his bag. He kissed his sleeping son gently, hugged Meera tight, and
                whispered, “I’ll be back soon. Just wait for me.”
            </p>
            <p>Tears rolled down her face. “Promise me. you’ll come back.”
            </p>
            <p>“I promise,” he said, though his heart carried the weight of uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>On the way to the base, he called his parents. “I’m going to Jammu, Kashmir. Please pray for us.” His
                voice was steady, but inside, he knew the risk.
            </p>
            <p>The battlefield was brutal.
            </p>
            <p>Cynical winds cut through their clothes. The nights were wakeful, and the days were spent amidst bullets
                and flames. Arjun, by now a very respected officer, fought his troops with valor. His thoughts ran to
                Ayush's laughter, to Meera's smile, to the tranquil hills of Dhorpatan.
            </p>
            <p>And then, one cold winter morning, in the midst of a battle on the border, Arjun was hit when he was
                protecting his friends. He struggled to his very last breath, protecting his friends.
            </p>
            <p>He became a hero in death.
            </p>
            <p>Epilogue: A Legacy of Love
            </p>
            <p>The news came like thunder on a summer afternoon. Dhorpatan wept. His parents were in a state of frantic
                despair. Meera fainted when she heard the words, her heart shattered beyond repair. Ayush, too young to
                understand, only asked. "Where's Papa?"
            </p>
            <p>The army provided Arjun with a send-off ceremony. His body was brought back to Dhorpatan, wrapped in the
                flag he had so long coveted wearing. Guns boomed in honor. Flowers were heaped over his coffin.
            </p>
            <p>Years passed.
            </p>
            <p>Meera, shattered, was brave for her son. She raised Ayush in stories of sacrifice, heroism, and love.
                They walked into the garden every night where she had met Arjun. Under the sky with its setting sun,
                she'd tell Ayush, "Your father was a hero. And he loved us more than anything else."
            </p>
            <p>Arjun's photograph still hung on their wall—smiling in uniform, ageless.
            </p>
            <p>Though he was gone, his tale stayed with him—engraved in the heart of a son, spoken by Dhorpatan's winds,
                and recalled by a nation as the tale of a boy with bigger dreams, a soldier who wished to be a man, and
                a man who gave everything up for duty and love.
