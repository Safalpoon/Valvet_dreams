            <h3>Part I: Whispers in the Dust</h3>
            <p>In the dark corners of an abandoned library, the whispers of forgotten stories get to live whenever there
                is a full moon. Westbrook Public Library was empty for nearly a decade, its beautiful marble facade
                weathered by time and neglect. Vines crawled into shattered windows, and dust swirled like snow on
                once-smooth study tables. It was shunned by most of the townspeople, who said that it gave them a creepy
                feeling—feeling as though they were being watched by dozens of unseen eyes.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza Morgan never heeded warnings. Twenty-six years old, holder of a master's degree in library science,
                and intrigued by lost places, the abandoned library was too attractive to resist. Her research on lost
                books had taught her well about rumors in the Westbrook collection—rare volumes that had seemingly
                vanished into thin air when the library suddenly closed its doors.
            </p>
            <p>"You don't have to go alone at all," her coworker Marcus had cautioned her that day. "Those old buildings
                are unstable."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll be fine," she'd assured him, not telling him that this was the night of the full moon—the best
                night to go, according to the local legend she'd read about.
            </p>
            <p>And now, with night beginning to descend over Westbrook, the small town, Eliza walked towards the
                foreboding building. Her flashlight skip jumped across the columns as she climbed the shattered steps.
                The massive oak doors were padlocked, but her excavation had revealed a service door at the back used by
                some of the town's adolescents to dare one another.
            </p>
            <p>The rusty door creaked in protest as she pushed it open, the sound carrying out into the darkness
                outside. Eliza halted, her heart racing. Something in the sensation of the darkness within was
                wrong—thick, alive somehow. She activated her headlamp and stepped inside.
            </p>
            <p>The service corridor opened into what had been the circulation room. Dead carts cracked still under books
                never to find their shelves again. The check-out desk loomed like a ruin, half-immersed in ceiling
                plaster and grime. The noise of Eliza's footsteps rang out more loudly over the marble floor as she
                ventured deeper into the library.
            </p>
            <p>"Hello?" she called out, even sounding foolish in the act of forming the word. Who should answer her?
            </p>
            <p>But something responded—not in voice, but by a sense of fine shifting around her. Her dust motions danced
                more pointed. A flutter of noise licked at her ear, too insubstantial to hear words in but inexcusably
                alive.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza turned around. "Is there anyone?"
            </p>
            <p>Silence was the only reply she got. She took her breath, keeping in mind to herself all the rational
                explanations—ancient ancient buildings, air circulated by ducts, the mind tricking her in darkness.
            </p>
            <p>The big reading room lay before her, its beamed ceiling almost undetectable in the light. Towering
                shelves ran along walls, most still laden with books. Amidst the space were reading tables in concentric
                circles, each one of them facing the platform where a lone podium stood by itself.
            </p>
            <p>Something called her to the podium. She moved, her light touching the edge of an open book, its pages
                yellow but untouched by the layer of dust that covered everything else.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza's hand hesitated, brushing out toward it. As her fingers came into contact with the worn leather
                cover, the air changed again. The whispers grew stronger, a susurration of inter tangled voices like the
                crashing of the waves on far seas.
            </p>
            <p>The cover of the book was written in rusty gold: "Echoes of Silence: Collected Stories of the Forgotten."
                There was no author's name. Eliza delicately creased the front page, where she discovered written words
                in lovely, flowing script.
            </p>
            <p>"Those who speak when none can hear still deserve to be remembered," the first sentence read. "Their
                words echo in the spaces between moments, waiting for listening ears."
            </p>
            <p>When moonlight began filtering through the tall windows and bathing the reading room in a silver glow,
                the mumblings were heard more distinctly. Eliza shivered knowing that she could almost hear words.
            </p>
            <p>She turned the page to find out about another librarian, one named Thomas Weldon, who had worked at
                Westbrook in the 1930s. His story told of how he came to realize that some books contain not only what
                is written upon their pages—but also resonations of their readers, fragments of thoughts and sentiments
                left behind by individuals who delve into a work.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza's head jerked up from the book at the sound of rustling, as if pages were being flipped. Over at
                one of the reading room tables, a figure hunched forward over an opened book. The figure glowed softly
                with a light blue color.
            </p>
            <p>She automatically wished to flee, but curiosity kept her rooted to the spot. The figure—a costumed male
                figure—was not threatening. He appeared completely absorbed in what he was reading, not even aware of
                her.
            </p>
            <P>As Eliza got up, the other forms began to appear in the room—men and women from different eras, all with
                noses buried between pages, all emitting the same unearthly glow. They did not seem to see one another
                or her.
            </P>
            <P>The murmurs now were a muted murmur, the voice of a score of ghost readers reacting to what they read,
                chatting away to themselves, answering tales of long ago.
            </P>
            <p>Eliza looked down at the book in her own hands, and at the ghost readers. Thomas Weldon had found a way
                to banish these echoes, to lead them off on nights when the full moon created an insidious boundary
                between recollection and fact.
            </p>
            <p>One of the figures—a young woman wearing a 1950s-era dress—looked up directly at Eliza. Eyes collided in
                space. The woman's face changed from astonishment to bliss. She got up, holding the book against chest,
                and headed for Eliza.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you seeing me?" the ghost whispered, a rustle of fallen leaves in sound.
            </p>
            <p>"Yes," Eliza pulled in air, her cynicism banked up at university denying what she saw. "Who are you?"
            </p>
            <p>"Eleanor Hayes," replied the ghostly-grinning woman. "First time somebody's ever spoken back to me. Well,
                I don't know. Time runs differently for us." She extended an arm across the room. "We're the
                Readers—people who preferred books over remaining alive to read them on beyond."
            </p>
            <p>"You're. ghosts?" Eliza stuttered, attempting to comprehend what she was witnessing.
            </p>
            <p>Eleanor chuckled, the ring of wind chimes in the distance. "Not precisely. More like echoes. Impressions
                people left behind when they discovered fragments of their souls in these books." She pointed at the
                book in Eliza's hand. "Thomas referred to it as 'resonant memory.' He was able to keep us, to give us
                form when the conditions were favorable."
            </p>
            <p>Before Eliza was able to say a word, someone else appeared—an old gentleman in round glasses and a bow
                tie.
            </p>
            <p>"A guest who can see us!" he exclaimed. "How wonderful. Thomas Weldon, at your service." He bowed
                seriously. "I see you found my journal."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza gazed down at the book in her hand. "You wrote this? About the echoes?"
            </p>
            <p>"Indeed." Thomas nodded. "My life's work has been to understand the phenomenon. People leave traces of
                themselves in books they love—emotional residues, if you will. I discovered a way to amplify those
                residues on the full moon."
            </p>
            <p>"But why is the library empty?" Eliza asked. "What was going on here?"
            </p>
            <p>Thomas and Eleanor exchanged a look. "That," Thomas said resolutely, "is a story for which you may not be
                ready."
            </p>
            <p>As if on cue, the whispers in the room changed, becoming desperate, warning. The specter readers all
                began looking around nervously.
            </p>
            <p>"He's coming," Eleanor whispered. "You should go."
            </p>
            <p>"Who's coming?" Eliza asked, but Thomas already had her by the arm and was shoving her toward the
                shelves.
            </p>
            <p>"The Collector," Thomas said, his tone ominous. "He doesn't approve of the living desecrating his
                library."
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Part II: The Collector's Library
            </h3>
            <p>Among the books of classic philosophy, Eliza saw the ghost readers in the central room begin to disappear
                or step back into the shelves. The soft murmuring ceased, and only the distant heavy breathing of her
                own air was heard.
            </p>
            <p>"Who is the Collector?" she asked Thomas, standing next to her, his ghostly presence casting pale blue
                light on the dusty spines.
            </p>
            <p>"Marcus Webb," Thomas replied. "He was head librarian after my time, in the 1960s. Brilliant, but.
                obsessive. He thought books were more valuable than people."
            </p>
            <p>"That doesn't sound so terrible for a librarian," said Eliza.
            </p>
            <p>Thomas shook his head. "You don't get it. He didn't just prefer books—he thought books were better served
                than to be touched by what he referred to as 'temporary beings.' Us. Humans."
            </p>
            <p>"But he was human too," Eliza argued.
            </p>
            <p>"Was," Eleanor gasped from beside her. "Until he found the Codex Umbra."
            </p>
            <p>Thomas had nothing more to say before a cold wind shrieked through the library. Dust on the floors
                swirled up into small whirlwinds. Moonlight streaming through the windows dimmed, as if something was
                sucking the light away.
            </p>
            <p>A tall, dark figure stood in the middle of the reading room. This ghost was unlike the others—thicker,
                but still transparent, darker as if sliced from darkness rather than light. He wore a rumpled
                three-piece suit and moved in slow, measured steps as he scanned the room.
            </p>
            <p>"I smell you," the Collector bellowed, his voice ringing with a non-human timbre. "Beating heart, living
                flesh. You intrude into my collection."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza backed further into the shadows. Thomas placed a reassuring hand near her shoulder but not on it,
                for that would have floated through it—yet still comforting.
            </p>
            <p>"The Codex Umbra was a medieval guidebook to soul-capture," Thomas painted. "Marcus tethered himself to
                the library with death using it. He is neither a living human nor a ghost, but between them."
            </p>
            <p>"What's he after?" Eliza painted.
            </p>
            <p>"To depart from his collection untouched. And." Thomas hesitated.
            </p>
            <p>"And to continue adding to it," Eleanor filled in. "He hordes the footprints of readers—like
                us—incorporating them in the library for all time."
            </p>
            <p>"We remained," Thomas replied. "Glad to remain near books we loved. But the Collector seizes silences
                that would otherwise die by themselves. And sometimes."
            </p>
            <p>"Sometimes he takes more than silences," Eleanor whispered. "That's why the library closed. People
                vanished."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza's blood ran cold. "He murdered them?"
            </p>
            <p>"Transformed them," Thomas replied. "Into eternal silences. Not alive, not dead."
            </p>
            <p>The Collector strolled past the reading tables, following a dark hand across them. Where he went, the
                dust disappeared, and the wood shone with a bright polish.
            </p>
            <p>"Come out, little mouse," he invited. "No point in hiding. All this library is indexed. All has its
                place."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza tightened her grip on Thomas's journal. "What do I do?"
            </p>
            <p>"The journal," prompted Thomas. "My research. I learned how to reverse the binding charm of the Codex
                Umbra. That's why he can't take us whole—well, at least not yet, anyway—because we do too much."
            </p>
            <p>"If you can crack the reversal spell," Eleanor went on, "you would be able to free us all—and protect
                yourself."
            </p>
            <p>"I could use a bit more light," Eliza whispered, regarding her dwindling flashlight hesitantly.
            </p>
            <p>Thomas pointed to the back of the philosophy aisle. "There is a reading area with windows. The moonlight
                will be enough there."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll distract him," Eleanor offered, her form already fading.
            </p>
            <p>"No!" Thomas whispered urgently, but Eleanor was already floating toward the room's center.
            </p>
            <p>"Marcus Webb," she bellowed, her voice stronger than it had been in years.
            </p>
            <p>The Collector rotated, his dark silhouette appearing as though it enlarged. "Eleanor Hayes. Reader of
                romantic fiction. I have been looking for you."
            </p>
            <p>With Eleanor walking the Collector away, Thomas led Eliza between the shelves towards the reading nook.
                They passed in silence, avoiding creaking boards that Thomas evaded by association.
            </p>
            <p>The reading alcove was a small recess under a tall, arched window with a seat to sit and look out.
                Moonlight streamed in and caused the dust motes to glimmer like small stars. Eliza settled into silver
                light and opened the journal.
            </p>
            <p>"See the section on binding reversal," Thomas instructed, standing guard near the edge of the alcove.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza flipped through the pages until she came to a heading that read "Countering Umbral Bindings." The
                text described how the Codex Umbra got its power from stolen moments—remembrances that it robbed from
                its readers and bound to the physical environment of the library.
            </p>
            <p>"To unmake such bindings," she read quietly, "one must speak on behalf of the silenced. Their stories
                must be told, their names said, their echoes let out to dissolve or linger at will."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes," Thomas nodded. "The Collector's power lies in enforced silence—stories truncated, lives ended. The
                antidote is acknowledgment."
            </p>
            <p>A commotion in the main reading room broke them up. Eleanor's scream—tortured and frightened—echoed
                through the library.
            </p>
            <p>"He's got her," Thomas snarled. "We don't have much time."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza continued reading in the diary, finding a ritual that included "reading" the names of the trapped
                ones aloud while holding books they had loved. "How do I know which books are which echoes'?"
            </p>
            <p>"The resonance will tell you," Thomas said. "When you hold a book close to its reader's echo, both will
                shine brighter."
            </p>
            <p>"Little mouse," the Collector's voice called out, nearer now. "I've found your friend. Perhaps you'd like
                to join in on our little chat of library manners."
            </p>
            <p>Thomas's frame shook with fear. "You'll have to start the ritual. I'll try to keep him from joining you."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza did not have a chance to object before Thomas floated off, his spectral form dissolving into the
                shadows between shelves of books. Eliza stood alone under the moonlight and took a deep breath, then
                returned to the journal.
            </p>
            <p>The ritual required a focal point—a book that would connect the world of the living to the echoes. The
                diary itself, since it belonged to Thomas, would be perfect. She also needed to find and identify at
                least seven bound echoes and bind them with their favorite books.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza slid back out of the stacks into the alcove and made her way towards the fiction section where
                Eleanor reported having spent most of her time. She could overhear Thomas arguing with the
                Collector—something regarding ethics of preservation vs. freedom.
            </p>
            <p>In the American literature corner, Eliza noticed a gentle light emanating from a copy of "To Kill a
                Mockingbird." She stepped closer, and a glimpse of a young man reading passionately emerged.
            </p>
            <p>"Excuse me," she breathed.
            </p>
            <p>The young man looked up, startled. "You can see me?"
            </p>
            <p>"Yes. What's your name?"
            </p>
            <p>"James Carter," he replied.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza's hand went out and touched the book in his hand, and it, and James, glowed. "James Carter," she
                said firmly, "I know your story. Your echo is yours."
            </p>
            <p>James's shape seemed to strengthen a bit more, his face a picture of wonder and increasing hope.
            </p>
            <p>She never had a chance to explain, for an icy gust whirled past her. The Collector's bellow boomed
                through the stacks. "STOP!"
            </p>
            <p>Eliza crouched along another row, just shy of the shadow as it drifted by. Six more echoes and she would
                complete the ritual. In poetry, she encountered a gray-haired woman with a copy of Emily Dickinson. In
                children's books, a middle-aged man is reading "Where the Wild Things Are" to an empty audience.
            </p>
            <p>She called out to each of them by name, each whisper accompanied by their selected book. Each time she
                said a name, the whispers within the library coalesced, and became more tangible.
            </p>
            <p>As soon as she found the sixth echo—a teenage girl hugged a worn "The Outsiders"—the Collector grew
                restless. Shelves rolled back behind Eliza as she moved forward. Books fell from their shelves, ripping
                through air like angry birds.
            </p>
            <p>"You know nothing!" the Collector yelled. "They are MINE! Their tales are for MY collection!"
            </p>
            <p>Eliza ran to the center reading room, where she had last seen the seventh echo—a woman holding a book of
                fairy tales. The Collector followed, a cloud of darkness and anger.
            </p>
            <p>In the midst of the reading room, Eleanor was trapped in some sort of supernatural snare, her
                luminescence growing dim. No Thomas was in sight.
            </p>
            <p>The fairy tale lady cowered under a reading table. Eliza sprang in beside her, clutching the last book.
            </p>
            <p>"Your name?" Eliza gasped.
            </p>
            <p>"Margaret Wilson," she whispered.
            </p>
            <p>"'Margaret Wilson,' said Eliza, putting her hand on the fairy tale book, 'I know your tale. Your echo is
                your own.'"
            </p>
            <p>The book and Margaret exploded into light that radiated like the sun as the Collector walked towards
                them. He yelled—a tearing paper sound and crunching spines.
            </p>
            <p>"The last words now!" Thomas's voice was somewhere near.
            </p>
            <p>Eliza opened the diary to the last page of ritual and read the words aloud: "What was taken must be
                returned. What was bound must be freed. What was silenced must be heard. The library stands not as a
                prison but as a possibility."
            </p>
            <p>The form of the Collector began to crumble, pieces of darkness shattering. "My collection," he mourned.
                "My precious books."
            </p>
            <p>"They were never yours, Marcus," Thomas said, materializing again. "Books belong to readers who read
                them, and readers to themselves."
            </p>
            <p>Ghostly whispers within the room thickened, materialized. Whispers formed voices—dozens, hundreds of
                readers voicing their thoughts, relating their stories.
            </p>
            <p>The Collector doubled up upon himself, diminishing into a faint shadow that oozed beneath floorboards and
                disappeared.
            </p>

            <h3>Part III: Stories Set Free
            </h3>
            <p>The dawn broke over the Westbrook Library, its first light rousing Eliza from slumber over a reading
                table, Thomas's journal open on her cheek. The ghostly readers were still present around her even as the
                moonlight faded—their faces stronger, clearer than she had last seen them.
            </p>
            <p>"Eliza," Thomas's voice awakened her gently. "You did it."
            </p>
            <p>She rubbed her eyes and was momentarily stunned. The previous night's events overwhelmed her. "The
                Collector?"
            </p>
            <p>"Basic to what he really was—nothing more than a shadow, but twisted by madness," Deanna elaborated, no
                longer in her cage. "He's still out there somewhere, but powerless."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza looked around the main reading room, now filled with ghostly readers of all ages and periods. They
                sat at the tables or along benches in the aisles, in quiet debate, others still absorbed in their books.
                The whispering had become the comforting hum of discussion.
            </p>
            <p>"What then?" Eliza asked, leaning forward in her seat.
            </p>
            <p>"Now they get to decide," Thomas said. "Some of the echoes will fade on their own, their function
                fulfilled. Others will stay behind, happy in this limbo. But now they have the choice."
            </p>
            <p>As if in answer, some of the specters brightened. Their bodies translucentized, then turned transparent,
                then disappeared entirely—leaving nothing but the faintest glimmer in the air.
            </p>
            <p>"They're moving on," Eleanor said. "Finding peace."
            </p>
            <p>The other echoes persisted, more substantial than ever. They floated through the library with new
                determination, straightening fallen books, dusting shelves with impossible hands.
            </p>
            <p>James Carter, the young man from the American literature section, approached Eliza.
            </p>
            <p>"Thank you," he said, his voice more distinct now than ever. "I've been stuck on the same chapter for
                decades. Now I can finally finish the book."
            </p>
            <p>Eliza smiled. "What will you read next?"
            </p>
            <p>"Anything," James whispered. "I have an entire library to read."
            </p>
            <p>As the morning continued, Eliza stood and observed as the ghost readers breathed new life into the vacant
                library. Although they could not restore the building physically, their presence brought life to the
                silent rooms and dusty shelves.
            </p>
            <p>"The town should re-open this location," Eliza told Thomas, gazing out a window overlooking Westbrook.
                "Physical readers could coexist with."
            </p>
            <p>"In tandem with us whispers," Thomas finished.
            </p>
            <p>"A good thought, but after everything that happened with the Collector, I doubt anyone would come," he
                said.
            </p>
            <p>"Unless they knew the truth," Eliza said. "The entire tale of what happened here—and might again."
            </p>
            <p>Eleanor came with a poetry book. "What do you propose?"
            </p>
            <p>"A restoration project," Eliza enthused, interest growing. "My research grant has money for one more
                year. I could record your histories, build community support to preserve the building."
            </p>
            <p>"A library where echoes and living readers share knowledge down the centuries," Thomas envisioned.
                "Dramatic."
            </p>
            <p>As they bounced ideas off one another, the spectral readers floated close, offering words of wisdom and
                swapping remembrances of the library in its heyday.
            </p>
            <p>By twelve o'clock, Eliza had page upon page of scribbled notes and a tsunami of resolve. It wasn't just
                about saving a building—it was about saving stories, rebuilding bridges between readers from one
                generation to the next.
            </p>
            <p>As she was leaving, promising to come back the following evening, Thomas escorted her to the door. "Take
                my journal," he insisted. "Read it. There is yet more to know of the nature of echoes."
            </p>
            <p>"Surely you will need it?" said Eliza.
            </p>
            <p>Thomas smiled as he spoke, "I have memorized every word. Besides, it should now be in living hands."
            </p>
            <p>At the door, Eleanor and one or two other echoes were present to wish her goodbye. "Will you really come
                back?" an echo of a small girl asked.
            </p>
            <p>"Wild horses wouldn't be able to keep me away," Eliza promised.
            </p>
            <p>Stepping out into the sunlight, Eliza turned to look back at the weathered exterior of the Westbrook
                Library. From the outside, it still looked empty, forgotten. But she knew better now. Inside those
                walls, so many stories went on—some between the lines, some between the echoes of whispers, all waiting
                to be told.
            </p>
            <p>She clasped Thomas's diary to her breast and started down the stairs, already writing the proposal she
                would present to the town council. The silent echoes would not be silent for much longer.
            </p>
            <p>For the next several months, Eliza was the portal between worlds. The restoration project got a boost of
                unwanted publicity when locals reported seeing lights in the library windows on nights of the full moon.
                There were tours—strictly controlled by Eliza—in which people would get a glimpse of the ghostly readers
                if the mood was favorable.
            </p>
            <p>The Westbrook Library reopened after one year with the unusual mission statement: "Preserving the
                dialogue between readers past, present, and future." It had silent reading halls specially designed for
                contemplative reflection where the boundary of distinction between current readers and echoes was the
                slightest.
            </p>
            <p>And on full-moon nights, when the library stayed open until dawn, one could hear the whispers—story
                telling tales, echoes responding to new readers, the continuing conversation of literature generation to
                generation.
            </p>
            <p>The Collector remained, a ghostly figure hidden in the cellar diaries' shadows. But he had also gained a
                sense—a sense of inventorying the oldest and weakest volumes, keeping in existence their memories as his
                own in the protected solicitude of Thomas and Eleanor.
            </p>
            <p>In the quiet rooms of the renovated library, whispers of ancient stories were stirred anew to be heard by
                all—no longer echoes, no longer quiet, but voices in a never-ending conversation about what it is to
                love books, to leave a part of yourself on the page, to reach out beyond the boundaries of time.
