            <h3>Valvet Memories
            </h3>
            <p>A collection of poems tracing the soft, elusive texture of memory—how it fades like dusk, shifts shape
                over time, and sometimes returns with startling clarity, brushing against the soul like velvet in the
                dark. These verses linger in the quiet spaces between what was said and what was felt, capturing the
                fragments of moments long gone but never truly lost.</p>
            <p>Through whispered nostalgia, quiet ache, and sudden bursts of forgotten joy, Velvet Memories invites you
                to wander the landscapes of the past—where echoes speak, shadows hold warmth, and every memory is
                stitched with light and longing.</p>
            <img src="/static/img/flower.jpg" alt="poem-flower">
            <p>Birthdays make us remember discreetly to linger awhile—if even just for the instant—to take a look over
                down the line we have lived and forward along the road still ahead. Through the burning candles and
                making wishes, there lies an unassuming softness of time moving on through us and shaping us to become
                who we will be. On my birthday, I did not think about age as a number, but as a succession of days—some
                bright, some quiet, all precious. In that silence, I composed this poem, not to celebrate another year,
                but to celebrate the journey, the growth, and the silence of beauty in life unfolding.</p>

            <p class="poem">Like a flower that blooms then fades away,
                So too, a person grows with each new day.
                Each night falls softly, a sun bids goodbye,
                And with each dawn, one more day drifts by.
                Step by step, age silently creeps near,
                But once a year, we pause to cheer.
                For in that moment, we celebrate,
                How life's a journey, steady yet great.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the soft glow of the moon, love has its own language. It is a soft serenade to yearning, to
                connection, and to the divine pull between two hearts that are destined to orbit each other. It is a
                letter to the way we find purpose in another's light, even in the darkness that appears endless. Let
                these words guide you through the slow dance of worship—a love so great, even the stars pause to listen,
                and the earth inhales.
            </p>

            <p class="poem">The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?
                My heart asks this again and again.
                From the moment my eyes met yours,
                Draped in red and black, like twilight’s flame.
                A glassy shimmer in your pearly gaze,
                Precious as oysters guarding their light.
                You are the moon I long to hold,
                Guiding me gently through the night.

                I am the Earth, and you, my moon,
                The only one my world will know.
                Without you, I am Mercury—lost,
                Or Pluto, buried in endless snow.
                So if love must fade like stardust bright,
                Let me rest in your glow once more.
                For even if the night must end,
                Will you die happily?</p>

            <h3>Still, I Wait</h3>
            <p>This poem is dedicated to the quiet form of love—the one that waits, not because it's easy, but because
                it's real. It's for the girl I love, the girl who may never know how I feel. But through every moment
                and every silence, I wait… hoping someday she'll see me.</p>
            <p class="poem">I stand where the cold winds blow,
                With love unspoken, yet you don’t know.
                My heart calls out, but you don’t hear,
                Still, I wait—year after year.

                The mountains whisper, the valleys sigh,
                Yet you pass like a cloud in the sky.
                You never look, you never stay,
                Still, I wait—day after day.</p>
            <p>
                During the night, when the world is hushed and the stars whisper their secrets softly, I am in thoughts
                of her. There is a maiden who surpasses all the stars in the sky, a beauty that surpasses the moon
                itself. She is the one whom I miss, the one whose heart I miss with the same love so pure, and I stand
                here, waiting—hoping that one day, she will enter my world and fill it with wholesomeness.
            </p>
            <p class="poem">
                Beneath the stars, her beauty glows, serene as silver light,
                Like moonlight on the quiet waves that dance into the night.
                Her smile, a dream the skies would keep, her eyes a gentle fire,
                She is the wish my heart repeats, my one and true desire.

                No one but her could touch my soul, no other love feels right,
                I wait with hope, through silent hours, beneath the pale moonlight.
                For when she comes, the world will sing, the skies will softly sigh—
                She is my love, my only one, my reason, and my why.
            </p>
