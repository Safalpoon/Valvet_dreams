            <h3>Part One: The Midnight Reply
            </h3>
            <p>"Hey SaaNjh, I'm sorry," I typed, my hands shaking as I hit send. Memories rushed back to me—memories of
                us. We had dated a few years ago, but SaaNjh broke up with me to focus on his studies. His dream was to
                become a doctor, and he was determined to get top grades. I understood his reasons, but my heart
                couldn't accept the distance that had grown between us.
            </p>
            <p>Back then, I tried to tell him how I felt, but he never really got it. I sent him messages on WhatsApp
                every day, hoping for a reply. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and eventually, a whole year
                passed. His silence was deafening. Still, I didn’t give up. Once a month, I would send a simple text
                like, "Hi" or "Hope you're doing well," just to let him know I still cared. It became my routine—a tiny
                spark of hope I clung to.
            </p>
            <p>Then, one day, something happened. After a year of being ignored, I saw it: the “read” receipt under my
                message. My heart raced. I stared at my phone, waiting for a reply that never came. Disappointment hit
                me hard, but deep down, that small acknowledgment was enough to keep my hope alive.
            </p>
            <p>Weeks later, at exactly 11:11 PM on an ordinary Tuesday night, my phone buzzed. The notification sound
                echoed in my quiet room, pulling me out of my thoughts. Nervous and hopeful, I grabbed my phone and
                opened the message. It was from him.
            </p>
            <p>"Hey," it said. Just one word. Simple, yet it felt like my whole world shifted. Tears filled my eyes, and
                for the first time in a long while, I smiled. We started talking again—slowly. His messages were short
                and distant, like he wasn’t sure if he wanted to continue. But even those small exchanges felt like
                sunshine breaking through after months of rain.
            </p>
            <p>Soon, we were chatting every morning and evening. Strangely, we never brought up the past or talked about
                our breakup. It was like we were rebuilding something fragile, piece by piece. I wanted to ask why he
                had been distant for so long but decided not to push my luck. His replies, though brief, became
                something I looked forward to each day.
            </p>
            <p>Our conversations ranged from everyday things like school and random jokes to dreams about the future.
                Sometimes, I caught myself smiling at my phone in public, earning odd looks from strangers—but I didn’t
                care. This was what I had been longing for: to reconnect with SaaNjh, to bridge the gap between us.
            </p>
            <p>After months of chatting, curiosity got the better of me. "Would you like to meet?" I asked one evening.
                There was a pause. My heart pounded as I waited. "I... I’ve got a lot going on with my studies," he
                replied. Disappointment tugged at my chest, but I quickly masked it with a reassuring, "I understand.
                Maybe another time."
            </p>
            <p>Then, out of nowhere, a few days later, a new message appeared on my screen: "Let’s meet this weekend.
                Jyaba Café. 2 PM."
            </p>
            <p>2 PM? It was an unusual time for me, but somehow it felt right—as if the stillness of that hour would
                make the moment more meaningful. Excitement and nerves swirled inside me as I stared at the screen. This
                was it. The chance I had been waiting for.
            </p>
            <p>I didn’t know what to expect at that café—the warmth of rekindled love, awkward silence, or something
                entirely different. But one thing was certain: sometimes, the moments we least expect can change
                everything.
            </p>
            <p>And I was ready to find out what awaited me.
            </p>

            <h3>Part Two: Lost in His Silence
            </h3>
            <p>It was Friday, and my heart was racing with anticipation. Tomorrow at 2 PM, I will finally see him after
                three long years. My happiness was indescribable. The hours seemed to stretch endlessly, making every
                second feel like a lifetime. The past three years had been filled with loneliness, longing, and
                unanswered questions. And now, I was finally going to get my moment, my closure, and maybe, just maybe,
                my love back.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Saturday arrived. I woke up early, feeling a mix of nervousness and joy. The morning sun
                streamed through my window, but the warmth did nothing to calm my anxious heart. I took a bath, had
                breakfast, and even cooked a little to keep myself occupied. But my thoughts were elsewhere. As the
                clock ticked closer to noon, I started getting ready. My hands trembled as I picked up my phone and
                typed a message: "I am very excited to meet you! I can't wait anymore."
            </p>
            <p>I stood in front of my wardrobe, completely puzzled about what to wear. Then, a memory flashed through my
                mind—he always loved me in a blue kurta. He used to shower me with beautiful compliments whenever I wore
                it, saying that blue made my eyes shine like the ocean under the moonlight. That decided it. I slipped
                into the blue kurta, my heart fluttering with excitement. As I looked at my reflection in the mirror, I
                whispered, "Today, we will rewrite our story."
            </p>
            <p>By 12:30, I was ready to leave. The café was an hour away, so I booked a cab and set off. The journey
                felt like an eternity. My heart pounded, beating like a nanosecond switch. "I've counted every
                heartbeat, every sunrise, and every lonely night just waiting for this moment—to finally hold you
                again."
            </p>
            <p>At 1:55 PM, I arrived at Jyaba Café. My eyes scanned the place eagerly, searching for him. My fingers
                fidgeted as I adjusted my dupatta. But then, suddenly, someone waved at me. Confused, I hesitated. He
                called out my name, "Hey Serena! How are you? Finally, we met!"
            </p>
            <p>I froze. My heart dropped. Who was this man? I had never seen him before. My mind spun with panic. This
                was wrong. This was not what was supposed to happen.
            </p>
            <p>"Who are you? Why are you calling me?" I asked, my voice trembling.
            </p>
            <p>He smiled awkwardly. "I am Vickey. But I was here to meet SaaNjh. How is it possible that you are here?"
            </p>
            <p>My world shattered as he continued, "Actually, we have been chatting for three months. The person you
                were chatting with was me."
            </p>
            <p>Rage boiled within me. "What? How is that possible? SaaNjh’s number—how did you get it?"
            </p>
            <p>Vickey sighed, looking guilty. "A few months ago, I went for a trip near the valley. While I was there, I
                found a phone lying abandoned on the roadside. It was damaged beyond repair, but curiosity got the best
                of me. I retrieved the SIM card, thinking it might be of use. I needed one, so I used it. One day, I saw
                your message notifications pop up. At first, I ignored them. But your persistence... your heavy messages
                didn’t let me be. It felt wrong, but at the same time, I didn’t want to shatter your hope."
            </p>
            <p>Tears welled up in my eyes. My whole world collapsed in an instant. The person I had been longing for
                wasn’t here. It had all been a lie. The countless nights I spent dreaming of this moment, the texts, the
                aching loneliness—it had all been for nothing.
            </p>
            <p>Vickey looked down at the table. "I called you here today because I wanted to tell you the truth. I am
                really sorry."
            </p>
            <p>I wiped my tears away, unable to process the betrayal. My chest ached with disappointment. Still, we sat
                down, had some snacks, and talked. He apologized again and again. Surprisingly, I didn’t hate him. He
                had no ill intentions—he just got caught up in an unfortunate situation. And deep down, I knew he was
                telling the truth.
            </p>
            <p>Before I left, he asked, "Can we be friends?"
            </p>
            <p>I hesitated. Then, with a sigh, I nodded. "Fine. But I have one request. Help me find SaaNjh. I need to
                see him. I need to know why he left."
            </p>
            <p>Vickey smiled reassuringly. "Don’t worry, Serena. I will help you. We will find him."
            </p>
            <p>After that, we began searching for SaaNjh. His dream was to become a doctor, so we started looking for
                medical colleges offering MBBS programs. After months of searching, we finally found his name listed in
                one of the colleges, thanks to information from Vickey’s friends. I was overjoyed at that moment.
            </p>
            <p>Without wasting any time, we went to the college to meet him. But when we arrived, we couldn’t find him.
                My heart pounded with unease. And then, a professor’s words shattered my world—
            </p>
            <p>"I’m sorry… he is no longer in this world."
            </p>
            <p>I stood there, frozen. The air felt heavy, suffocating. My mind refused to process his words. I broke
                down, tears streaming down my face, my heart drowning in sorrow.
            </p>
            <p>Desperate, I asked the professor, "This can’t be possible! How did this happen?"
            </p>
            <p>With a heavy sigh, he replied, "He was suffering from blood cancer… the final stage. We did everything we
                could, but we couldn’t save him."
            </p>
            <p>And just like that, the reason he left me… the reason he never told me… was because he was silently
                fighting a battle he knew he couldn’t win.
            </p>
            <p>I was shattered. Lost. Hopeless. But somehow, I had to move on. And in that dark time, Vickey stood by
                me, helping me piece my life back together.
            </p>
            <p class="poem">Yet, even now, on quiet nights, I whisper his name into the void,
                Hoping the wind will carry my voice to him, wherever he is.
                Because love doesn’t fade with distance or death—
                It lingers in the echoes of the heart, forever unheard, yet never forgotten.

            <h3>Part Three: In the Shadow of Love
            </h3>
            <p>I'm sorry... he is no longer in this world.
            </p>
            <p>I stood there, frozen. The air felt heavy, suffocating. My mind refused to process his words. I broke
                down, tears streaming down my face, my heart drowning in sorrow.
            </p>
            <p>Vickey placed a comforting hand on my shoulder, his voice gentle yet firm. "Sareena, let's go." He guided
                me away from the college gates, holding me up as my legs threatened to give way. I was lost, consumed by
                grief. The love of my life was gone, and I never even got to say goodbye.
            </p>
            <p>It started to drizzle, as if the sky itself was mourning alongside me. We went back to the café where we
                first met, the same place where my heart had first shattered upon learning of the cruel deception. Now,
                it shattered again, but this time, the pain was real. The truth was unbearable.
            </p>
            <p>Vickey ordered us coffee, but I barely touched mine. My hands trembled, my mind clouded with thoughts of
                SaaNjh. How could he leave me like this? How could he battle such pain alone? How could I ever forget
                his voice, his laughter, the warmth of his presence? The memories we built together played in my mind
                like a broken record, each one more painful than the last.
            </p>
            <p>Suddenly, my phone rang. It was Vickey.
            </p>
            <p>I answered in a small voice, "Hello?"
            </p>
            <p>"Sareena," he sighed, "please, try to let go. SaaNjh is gone. He can't come back. You have to move on."
            </p>
            <p>I swallowed the lump in my throat. "Can we go to his house? I need to meet his family. I need to know
                more... I need closure."
            </p>
            <p>Vickey hesitated. "Is that really necessary? Sareena, this will only bring you more pain."
            </p>
            <p>"Please, Vickey," I whispered. "Just one last time. Help me."
            </p>
            <p>He let out a resigned sigh. "Fine. We'll go this weekend."
            </p>
            <p>The days dragged on, each second a reminder of the upcoming visit. I counted every heartbeat, every
                breath, as if they were leading me to some inevitable conclusion. And then, finally, the day arrived.
            </p>
            <p>Vickey and I booked a cab and set off on the 80 km journey to SaaNjh's home. The drive was long and
                silent, but Vickey never let go of my hand. He was my anchor, keeping me from drowning in my grief.
            </p>
            <p>After three hours, we reached our destination. SaaNjh's family recognized me instantly and welcomed me
                with open arms. His mother’s eyes filled with tears as she embraced me, her pain mirroring my own. I
                introduced Vickey as a friend, and we were invited inside.
            </p>
            <p>We sat in the living room, sipping the tea they had prepared for us. My heart felt heavy as I finally
                asked the question that had haunted me since that terrible day. "Auntie, how did this happen? Why didn't
                he tell me?"
            </p>
            <p>His mother wiped her tears, her voice trembling. "I found out by accident. One day, I was cleaning his
                room when I found a hospital report tucked away in his book rack. My hands shook as I read it. I
                couldn't believe what I was seeing. I called his father, and we rushed to the hospital to confirm the
                truth. The doctor told us... he was in the final stage of blood cancer. There was nothing they could
                do."
            </p>
            <p>I covered my mouth, holding back my sobs as she continued, "We confronted him. He just smiled and said,
                'I'm sorry, Mom. I didn’t want to burden you with this. I wanted to spend my remaining days without
                worrying you.'"
            </p>
            <p>Her voice broke, and so did my heart. He had hidden his pain to protect us. He had suffered alone,
                knowing he was running out of time. I felt both proud and devastated.
            </p>
            <p>I excused myself and walked into his room. My breath hitched when I saw my photo hanging on the wall. He
                had kept me close, even in his last days. I traced the frame with trembling fingers, a mix of love and
                sorrow washing over me.
            </p>
            <p>That evening, Vickey and I left for home. The ride was quiet, filled with unspoken words and emotions too
                heavy to express. When I reached home, Vickey texted me.
            </p>
            <p><b>"The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?"
                </b></p>
            <p>My heart fluttered. That phrase… It carried a deeper meaning. It was a way of saying, "I love you."
            </p>
            <p>For the first time in a long while, I felt warmth spread through my chest. Vickey had been there for me
                in my darkest moments. He had held me together when I was breaking apart. And somewhere along the way,
                he had become the light guiding me out of my sorrow.

            <p>I replied, "I will die happily…"
            </p>
            <p>And from that night, our new journey began.
            </p>
            <p>Vickey proved his love with every action, every word. He never tried to erase SaaNjh’s memory but instead helped me cherish it while finding my own happiness. SaaNjh’s mother welcomed me as her own, knowing that if he were alive, I would have been her daughter-in-law.
            </p>
            <p>Now, as I stand beneath the moonlight, hand in hand with Vickey, I whisper a silent prayer to the one I lost. SaaNjh will always be in my heart. Love never fades—it just transforms. And somehow, I know, wherever he is, he is smiling, watching over me.
            </p>
            <p>Because love lingers, eternal and unbroken, in the echoes of the heart.
            </p>
